This repo is the Partially-Average Navier-Stokes turbulence models based on the k-Epsilon/k-omega-SST RAS model.

The codes was first developed by [HelioVillanueva](https://github.com/HelioVillanueva/helio-4.x) for OpenFOAM-4.x.

The codes was updated to compile with the latest OpenFOAM-v2012, and compatability with the OpenFOAM-8 distribution is underway.

To compile the turbulence models just copy the contents of the cloned folder to your OF user folder and run the Allwmake scrip in src/TurbulenceModels.
